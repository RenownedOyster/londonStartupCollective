      <h2>WHAT WE DO</h2>
      <p>
        We are an invitation only start up community of talented makers, coders, &amp; techies motivated by three simple
        principals:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Money is not the root of all evil, it is a tool</b></li>
        <li><b>Grinding hard at what you believe in is virtue</b></li>
        <li>
          <b>A mediocre plan executed now beats the perfect plan executed next month</b>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        And more often that not more money does mean a better life. Not only for one's self but for our families, our
        friends, &amp; the charities we can contribute to.
      </p>

      <h2>HOW WE DO IT</h2>
      <p>We create start ups</p>
      <p>
        We go in hard. While we understand that working long hours is not the life-style for everyone, but it is for
        us.<br /><br />We're willing to put in the time it takes to achieve our goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        We meet up every week as a collective &amp; pool our collective resources to help each other achieve their goals
        as individuals &amp; as micro think-tanks.
